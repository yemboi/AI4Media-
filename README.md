Text to image generation - Creating a Raphael (renaissance) cartoon using biblical text
The project is a latent diffusion model which has been trained with 7 paintings of Raphael. The images are all stories from the Christian bible, which have all have been captioned with the biblical text that they originated from. The aim of this project is to try recreate the images using machine learning. 
The application was built using the stable diffusion model   
The project can be installed and view by cloning the git repo that is included as an attachment. Due the size of the session and model files were not able to be installed. 
I have attached screenshots of the working model here, with a number of examples
